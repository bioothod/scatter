scatter (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * server: connection must be closed in drop() method, it will stop and clear its expiration thread.
  * server: fixed broadcast groups announce when new server has connected to server, which currently handles group, which has to move
  * server: fixed resolver use, since it is sync and return resolver::iterator now
  * broadcast: use connection::shared_completion_t for broadcast completions, do not use vector in completion, since it can be updated in parallel, which may crash
  * node: resolver is sync now and returns resolve::iterator
  * connection: when connection is going down, its expiration module must be closed first,
  * 	since it can have links (hold shared pointers) to conneciton which will prevent connection from being freed
  * 	and will eventually timeout and crash, since connection and expiration thread will be freed from expiration thread itself.
  * connection: cleanup message sending, move shared completion into public visible space,
  * 	use common constructor for empty/self connection (added empty process/error callbacks)
  * resolver: get rid of boost::asio::use_future, it can not be compiled with g++ 5.3.1, but it became synchronous
  * server: close acceptor and all accepted connections before exiting, remove connection from accepted set when it is being closed
  * test: added very basic connection test
  * pool: wait until all pending tasks are completed
  * node: close all connections before exiting, do not request connections if current connection already exists
  * message: explicitly initialize all header fields
  * route: return error insert/remove has failed, fail insertion if there exists connection with the same ids
  * address: fixed family assignment, added verbose logging
  * connection: added transaction expiration and test
  * node: randomly initialize node's ID
  * Added ribosome dependency
  * test: fixed sign warnings
  * package: do not depend on gtest, it is downloaded and installed by cmake instructions
  * cmake: download and install gtest-1.7.0
  * debian: fixed glog dependency
  * Create README.md
  * Updated license to LGPL-3.0
